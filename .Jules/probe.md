# Probe QA & Testing Journal

## 2026-03-31 - Session Deletion vs Library Materials Persistence
**Learning:** `deleteSession` in `sessionService.js` was explicitly calling `.delete()` on related material tables (`session_notes`, `session_flashcards`, `session_resources`, `session_quizzes`), which destroyed library content upon session deletion. Database schema migration 029 established `ON DELETE SET NULL` constraints so materials survive session deletion and remain in the user's Library with detached `session_id`.
**Action:** When testing session lifecycle operations, verify that session deletion only removes the session row in `Study` and preserves all associated notes, flashcards, resources, and quizzes for Library queries.

## 2026-04-05 - Timezone Travel & Out-Of-Order Streak Calculations
**Learning:** `calculateStreakUpdate` evaluated `daysSinceActivity === 0` to identify same-day no-ops, but when users traveled westward across timezones or the International Date Line (or when client sync delivered backdated activity dates), `daysSinceActivity` was negative (`< 0`), causing `calculateStreakUpdate` to fall through and reset active streaks to 1.
**Action:** Always check `daysSinceActivity <= 0` when computing streak updates to ensure earlier or out-of-order activity dates safely return `noOp: true` without resetting active streaks or modifying `lastActiveDate`.

## 2026-04-06 - Client Notifications & Quiet Hours Verification
**Learning:** Client-side notification utilities (`isQuietHoursActive`, `recordNotification`) directly instantiated `new Date()`, which made quiet hours time calculation non-deterministic in unit tests. Furthermore, when Web Push subscriptions are active, local in-tab study reminder timers must be suppressed to avoid duplicate notifications.
**Action:** Pass optional `date` parameters to time-sensitive notification functions to allow deterministic time injection, and verify that `scheduleStudyReminder` returns `null` when `hasActivePushSubscription()` evaluates to `true`.
